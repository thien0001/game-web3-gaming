# 🌌 Anoma Web3 Gaming

**Everyone is equal in love and war...**

The world out there, war is so sad. I created this little game as a way to dedicate to **Anoma** and the Web3 community.

Inspired by **testnet Anoma** with four colors – white, blue, red, yellow – I recreated them not as gems, but as **four sharp square blocks**, becoming fierce bots for players to fight with.

This is not a war to destroy, but to **remember, laugh, and experience together**.

🎮 A little game but a **big tribute** to Anoma.
